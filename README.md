# Hindi-Text-Summarizer

There is an enormous amount of textual content available, and it continues to develop every day. The unstructured data on the Internet consists of web pages, news stories, status updates, and blogs. There is a great need to reduce much of these text data to shorter, targeted summaries that capture the salient details so that the user can navigate more effectively as well as check whether the larger documents contain the information that they seek. The text summary creates a condensed version of the original content.

The necessity for a summary arises because, due to a shortage of time, it is not always possible to read the entire material. Automatic text summarising methods are desperately needed to deal with the ever-increasing amount of text data available online, both to help find important information and consume it more quickly. After extensive research, we have discovered that there is a lack of text summarizers targeting the Hindi language.
